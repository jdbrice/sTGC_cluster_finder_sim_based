# sTGC_cluster_finder_sim_based

finder2_v1.cxx is the version I used before 2020/07/21 STAR FWD f2f meeting. I try divide one module into 8 pieces and combine 1D hits to 2D hits.
but this verision did not work now.

finder2.cxx is the current version I am writing with Daniel. 

root -l -b -q 'finder2.cxx("simulation_file_name")'
